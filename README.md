# Path Model of a (1,4,4) ANC System

This is a path model measured in our lab for (1,4,4) ANC simulation.

It contains two variables, corresponding to the primary path and the secondary path.

For the Model_Primary, the three dimensions represent the primary route sequence number, time series and physical/virtual route selection, respectively.

For Model_Secondary, , the four dimensions represent secondary source number, time series, error microphone number, and physical/virtual path selection, respectively.
