# Path Models

## ANC111_pathModel_duct.mat

Path models of a single-channel ANC system measured in a duct of our lab.

P is the primary path model and S is the secondary path model.

## ANC144_pathModel.mat

Path models measured in our lab for (1,4,4) ANC simulation.

It contains two variables, corresponding to the primary path and the secondary path.

For the Model_Primary, the three dimensions represent the primary route sequence number, time series and physical/virtual route selection, respectively.

For Model_Secondary, , the four dimensions represent secondary source number, time series, error microphone number, and physical/virtual path selection, respectively.
